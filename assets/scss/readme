Do not create folder name that is already exists in assets/css AND contain any files that is not compiled from scss file.

Example:
There is a folder assets/css/somefolder this folder contain .css file that is manually created.
Then you don't create folder at assets/scss/somefolder because it will be removed once build via command line.

This case is okay.
There is a folder assets/css/somefolder/myfolder this folder have only .css files that compiled from scss file or empty folder or folder is not exists.
Then you can create folder at assets/scss/somefolder/myfolder which is sub folder of somefolder.
