What do I need in this folder?

You need css, js folders. 
The font-awesome may be use or not depend on you. If you already have it then it is no need.

The images, multimedia, js-previewm css-preview folders are for document (preview) only.

The js-src, scss folders are for source files, it is no need for you except you would like to modify and rebuild things.
